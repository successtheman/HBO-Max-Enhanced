# HBO-Max-Enhanced
An updated extension of HBO Enhanced for chrome that works with HBO Max. I did not create this extension, the original extension is here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hbo-enhanced/kibhmcdemphikjllndhmdjfailnllbjo (NOTE: Original script has been modified by https://github.com/jesalgandhi and I updated the icon for the new HBO Max logo.)

Download these files as a zip, extract the HBO-Max-Enhanced-master.zip file (you should be left with a folder of the same name), go to settings>extensions>load unpacked in Chrome or Edge (chromium), and choose the folder.

This extension allows you to use the spacebar as a pause button and the left and right arrow keys as 10 sec forwards/backwards buttons. Unfortunately, the up and down arrow keys don't allow you to change the volume like in the original release.
